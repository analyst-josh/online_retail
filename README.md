### Recommendations

1. Prepare inventory early for Q4 (esp. November) to capture seasonal demand spikes.
2. Pair-up high-volume low-price items like T-light holders with premium items for upsell strategies.
3. Flag top-returned SKUs (e.g., in Dec 2011) for quality audit to reduce refund losses.
4. Promote mid-tier popular items with stable returns to maximize margin and minimize risk.
5. Set up monthly monitoring for unusual return volumes or revenue drops per SKU or category.
